This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: type mismatch. The function 'add' is defined to accept two numbers and return a number. However, the code attempts to call it with a string and a number, resulting in a type error. The solution demonstrates how to use type guards to handle different types of inputs, preventing the error.
